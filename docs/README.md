Welcome to the Earthquake Catalog Workshop! This repository contains materials for a workshop on earthquake catalogs, including data, scripts, and documentation.

Contributors: Eric Beauce, Gabrielle Tepp, Clara Yoon, Ellen Yu, Weiqiang Zhu (alphabetical order)

### 20 min - Introductions & Overview (All & Eric)
- Instructor intros
- Workshop goals/schedule
- Why earthquake catalogs and how to choose the right one? [maybe discuss limitations and reasons for using different types of catalogs here?]
- What is an eq catalog? Different end-users of eq catalogs? Scientific motivations for eq catalogs?

### 45 min - Regional Seismic Networks: Official Catalogs and Data Access (Ellen & Gabrielle)
- How regional catalogs are made and what they include
- SCSN catalog and special datasets
- ComCat
- Accessing waveform data and metadata
- Citing network data & catalogs

### 10 min - Break

### 105 min - Building Custom Catalogs with Modern Tools
- Event Pipeline + Machine Learning (Weiqiang & Clara) - 60 min
- Template Matching (Eric) - 45 min

### 10 min - Break

### 35 min - Evaluating Catalog Quality (All)
- Anomaly detection
- Visualization tools
- Magnitude of completeness
- Quality control
- Tips & tricks

### 15 min - Conclusion (All & Clara)
- Discuss limitations and reasons for using different types of catalogs
- When to use STA/LTA vs deep-learning vs template-matching vs relocated
- Combining different methods (also with STA/LTA?) depending on application
- How does a user choose among the many options for deep-learning pickers, event associators, event location methods?

### 20 min - Discussion, Questions, & Tutorial Help
